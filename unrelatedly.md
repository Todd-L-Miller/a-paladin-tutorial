An elf lives where a little finger of the woods makes it all the way to the
way from the crossroads to the docks.  She makes breakfast pies, and lunch
pies, and dinner pies, and her place is always open -- she dosn't mind if
you interrupt her trance, as long you bring a good story.  She grows flowers
in front of her tent -- it's a permanent structure, in that square-and-triangle
style that children draw houses -- for the looks, and everything she needs for
the pies in the wood and glades behind.  The tent is on a wood-plank platform,
so it's a step up to get inside.  There's a row of sandals at the top of the
steps, and a sign asking you to change shoes before you enter her home.

The inside is a little less square than you might expect.  The tent fabric
doesn't really billow at all -- it's clearly held in tension by the rope
lacing -- but the struts are just a little bent, or maybe were carved from
branches of the right diameter rather than cut.

Nobody knows it the elf actually owns her land, but nobody tries to farm
there, either.
