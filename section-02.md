## Section 2

Suddenly, [skeletons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17015-skeleton)!  The goal of this scene is to move the player character from the training field to an environment where it's easier for us to constrain the player's choices.  The old catabombs east of town sound like a good place to me.

_A page sprints up to **Instructor Badsmith**.  The page is dressed liked you, but wearing brown leather armor and carrying a short bow, instead.   Instructor Badsmith's first name isn't "sir," you're pretty sure, but everyone seems to pretend that it is.  "Sir!" the page pants.  "**Knight-Commander Harris** summons aid!"  Badsmith holds up his off hand, palm out.   "**Fondulac**," she commands, naming the fastest squire, "go, ring the alarm bell, then tell **Principal Volthall** what you just heard."  Quite properly, Fondulac salutes and begins to recite the order back: "Go, ring the alarm bell, tell Principal --" but Badsmith has already turned back to the page.  Fondulac swallows and departs at her considerable top speed.  Badsmith asks, "Where are we going?" and lowers his hand._

_Last year, your job in an emergency was to go back to the barracks -- or the great hall of the abbey, if the barracks were on fire -- and stay out of the way.  This year, you and your whole class are marching to the catacombs east of town.  You listen intently, along with everyone else, to the page.  Knight-Commander Harris, the second-in-command of your school, had been taking the senior squires on a field march: knights had the responsibility to lead if an officer wasn't available, so squires have to practice leadership._  Ask the player what their favorite (school) class is.  _They'd noticed a single skeleton, destroyed it, and -- you hoped the squire who made the decision wouldn't get in trouble for it -- followed its trail to make sure there weren't any more.  There must have been, if they had to call for help, but you can't make any sense of the story after the page entered the catacombs.  Badsmith sends the page to the principal -- although you're sure the principal saw your class march off and can follow your trail -- and grumbles.  "That's why we train all of you in making reports!"  You -- and your whole class -- respond in between thumping strides and rasping chain mail.  "Sir, yes, sir!"_

Instructor Badsmith -- like everyone else -- is unnerved by uncertainty.  If you'd like to introduce attribute checks, now would be a good time for a CON check, as he pushes the marching pace; everybody still arrives in a group, but if the player fails the check, they'll arrive towards the back of the group.  Failure is usually more interesting than success, but ask the player to describe the results either way.

### The Old Crypt

_You arrive at the old crypt.  When all the dead laid to rest here have been transformed by time and the power of the living earth into good soil, that soil will be brushed from the stones by a living descendant and taken back up to the light, to renew the soil of the family farm, or a memorial garden, or the charitable and beneficent plots owned by the temples that provide for orphans.  It would have been safer to just burn the bodies, but to do so makes the villagers.. uneasy._   Ask the player if they know why, and if they feel the same way.

_Of course, you and your classmates and your instructors and the Alandoorians -- all of everybody -- know that a proper burial isn't just digging a hole and hoping some passing necromancer doesn't notice.  That's what crypts are for: mighty fortresses of stone and life and sacred power.  Stone -- in arches and vaults and beds -- to shelter the dead so burrowers and earthquakes do not disturb their rest.  Sacred power -- enchantments of form and word -- to blind, baffle, and bend away those who would abuse the sleepers.  Life -- gardens under the ground, of moss and mushroom and other things whose names you do not yet know -- to transform the honored dead into stronger life._  Ask the player if they don't know because haven't taken that class yet, or if they just didn't do well in it.

_Traditionally, the living and the dead enter the crypt going down the ramp to the right; the living then exit up the ramp the left.  Traditionally, the dead do not exit the crypt.  Each ramp is covered by its own set of arches; long, heavy chains run from the keystones to a mighty iron winch.  You had to polish and oil the winch once, and that was enough; if you'd been just a little bit slower getting back to your room, you would've had to clean the chains, as well._  Ask the player what happened.

_At the bottom of each ramp, where it turns into a tunnel, you can see three gates: a cold, hard wood, and obdurate stone, each cunningly crafted to permit inspection of the one beyond.  Further down the tunnel, you know, there will be three more ages, in the opposite order, marking the boundary between here-and-now and the there-and-when, past and future together.  Each of the gates you can see stands open._

_Instructor Badsmith exclaims, "What crimes are these?  The gates open and unguarded, the fail-safe unstaffed?"  He walks briskly to the winch and orders your class into defensive positions.  You end up standing close enough to hear Evaroom report: "The problem isn't the necromancy, although that's bad enough.  It's that the sacred power is weakening even as we stand here.  We_ must _halt the decay as soon as possible."_
