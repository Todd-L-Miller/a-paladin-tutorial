### The Old Crypt

From a distance, the old crypt is just a fenced-off part of the grassy
common east of town, where someone has spent some time cultivating blue
flowers, white flowers, and shade trees with evocative names, like
weeping willow, crying crabapple, and moaning myrtle.  Which is technically
a shrub.  Anyway, it's a nice place to picnic, because the fence keeps the
sheep and other animals and their waste out, mostly.  (The gates aren't
locked, but if you don't close them all the way when you leave, they can
be pushed opened.  This gets you into a lot of a trouble even if no animal
takes advantage of your mistake.)  Going to picnic, when you go through
the gates, you can see both of the old crypt's ramps and the giant winch
in front of each one.

Instructor Badsmith grudgingly assigns **Walv Anderson** to lead the
vanguard.  As the strongest knight present, the instructor should be the
first into danger, but as the *only* knight present, he's also the only
and commanding officer.. and the commander should not be hazarded lightly.
Walv is a fine squire, with good eyes and better ears; a choice for
point that you understand.  (Ask the player what, exactly, they understand.)
What you're doing bringing up the rear, you don't know; it's normally a
position of great responsibility, which you've done nothing to deserve.

You continue to walk backwards, nonetheless; that's the rule.  It's the
responsibility of your squadmates to make sure you don't back into
anything, and one they've already taken seriously, letting you know where
the ramp down started and ended.  The ramp and the walls are made of the
same stone, sintered in some places and sundered in others in a regular
pattern designed to combat the freeze-thaw cycle.  Once you're fully
underground, the pattern will change, something about monocrystal construction
simply falling all to pieces in certain kinds of earthquakes.

It gets darker and darker, under the arches, as you walk further away
from the sun.  Your squadmates don't seem to stumble as much as you'd
expect, and you realize that their eyes have already adjusted, having
been looking into the dim light from the tunnel's ceiling the whole
way.  It's supposed to be a pale white, like the larger of the moons,
but something's wrong.  After a moment you figure it out: the walls and
floors -- all the stone in the tunnel that isn't supposed to be shedding
light -- is flourescing a pale blue.  You don't know what, if anything,
that means, but it's probably not a good sign.
