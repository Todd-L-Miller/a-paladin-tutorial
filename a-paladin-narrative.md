# Gwis the Grey


## Chapter 01

It's a rainy day in -- where will you be training?  Some small town,
it seems.  We'll say Alandoor -- Alandoor, and although that does make
it smell better, you've learned not to like the sound rains makes on
your chain mail, because that means you're going to have dry, polish,
and oil it again before you sleep.  You're wearing your armor and
carrying your long sword in a sheath at your hip and your shield on
your back because that's what squires at your school wear, that and
brown boots -- your instructors like you too much to make you wear
white boots -- and light gray pants and a light gray surcoat, on which
you carefully stitched a yin-yang symbol, which I can see is already
holy to you.

You and the rest of the class are standing out in the rain because the
healer, Evaroom, finally made it all the way around the county
and back to Alandoor for the day, and the instructors hate it when you
sword fight inside, even just for practice.  You'll have to learn how
some day, but not any day soon, apparently.  Anyway, because Evaroom is
here, it's safe -- safer, the instructors would say -- to practice using
real weapons, and they've given their permission.  You get in a lot of
trouble for doing anything fun without permission.  Garth and
Ennish are fighting right now, in the middle of a ring of everybody.
As usual, Garth (a minotaur) has better foot-work, but Ennish (who says
he's Cornish but looks more human than avian to you) moves his sword
very quickly and sometimes wins because of that.  The practice field is
all mud after just a few bouts, and after a few ringing attacks,
parries, counter-attacks, and counter-parries, Ennish gets his blade
past Garth's and forces Garth to jump out of the way.  Garth lands
badly, slips in the mud, falls, and suddenly it's your turn to
practice!  I'm not much of a fighter, so I can't tell what strengths
or weaknesses you'll bring to the ring, but perhaps you're more of a pearl --
irritating, but growing slowly and evenly and in all directions.

You and Ennish fight.  There's a lot of luck in a fight, so I can't tell
you who wins.  It'll matter a lot to you at the time, but never after; then
you, or maybe Ennish, lays their hands on the other -- and despite all your
differences, whatever they are, it'll hard to tell you two apart under all
the mud and sweat and steel.

Before Instructor Badsmith can call the next combatant forward, a page
sprints up to him.  The page is dressed like you, but wearing brown
leather armor and carrying a short bow, instead.  The instructor, of course,
is in gleaming full plate; you are morally certain that it's enchanted to
resist rain and rust and ruin right up until it's time for some poor squire
to clean it.  I don't know what you were thinking, but if you didn't want to
clean his armor, you should've stayed away from those chickens.

You're pretty sure Instructor Badsmith's first name isn't "sir," but everyone
seems to pretend anyway.  "Sir!" the page pants.  "Knight-Commander Harris
summons aid!"  Badsmith holds up his off hand, palm out.   "Fondulac,"
he commands, naming the fastest squire, "go, ring the alarm bell, then tell
Principal Volthall what you just heard."  Quite properly, Fondulac salutes
and begins to recite the order back: "Go, ring the alarm bell, tell Principal
--" but Badsmith has already turned back to the page.  Fondulac swallows and
departs at her considerable top speed.  Badsmith asks, "Where are we going?"
and lowers his hand.

Last year, your job in an emergency was to go back to the barracks -- or the
great hall of the abbey, if the barracks were on fire -- and stay out of the
way.  This year, you and your whole class are marching to the catacombs east
of town.  You listen intently, along with everyone else, to the
page.  Knight-Commander Harris, the second-in-command of your school, had been
taking the senior squires on a field march: knights had the responsibility to
lead if an officer wasn't available, so squires have to practice leadership.
I can tell you're looking forward to that, but I won't ruin the surprise by
telling you what your favorite class will be.

The squires had noticed a single skeleton, destroyed it, and -- you
hope the squire who made the decision wouldn't get in trouble for it --
followed its trail to make sure there weren't any more.  There must have
been, if they had to call for help, but you can't make any sense of the
story after the page entered the crypt.  Badsmith sends the page to
the principal -- although you're sure the principal saw your class march
off and can follow your trail -- and grumbles.  "That's why we train all
of you in making reports!"  You -- and your whole class -- respond in
between thumping strides and rasping chain mail.  "Sir, yes, sir!"


## Chapter 02

From a distance, the old crypt is just a fenced-off part of the grassy
common east of town, where people have spent time cultivating blue
flowers, white flowers, and shade trees with evocative names, like
weeping willow, crying crabapple, and moaning myrtle.  Which is
technically a shrub.  Anyway, it's a nice place to picnic, because the
fence keeps the sheep and other animals and their waste out, mostly.
(The gates aren't locked, but if you don't close them all the way when
you leave, they can be pushed opened.  This gets you into a lot of a
trouble even if no animal takes advantage of your mistake.)

Up close, you can see both of the old crypt's ramps and the giant winch
in front of each one.  Traditionally, the living and the dead enter the
crypt going down the ramp to the right; the living then exit up the ramp
the left.  Traditionally, the dead do not exit the crypt, but it seems
like this day will not be a good day for traditions.  Each ramp is
shaded by its own set of arches; long, heavy chains run from the
keystones to a mighty iron winch.  You had to polish and oil one winch
once, and that was enough; if you'd been just a little bit slower
getting back to your room, you would've had to clean the chains, as
well.  I'm sure you'll have a good excuse, and I'm just as sure that
your instructors will care just as much as I do.

You'll remember: when all the dead laid to rest here have been
transformed by time and the power of the living earth into good soil,
that soil will be brushed from the stones by a living descendant and
taken back up to the light, to renew the land of the family farm, or a
memorial garden, or the charitable and beneficent plots owned by the
temples that provide for orphans.  It would be safer to just burn the
bodies, but to do so makes the villagers.. uneasy.  I can see you feel
the same way; that speaks well of you, I think, although some
city-dwellers may disagree.

Of course, you and your classmates and your instructors and the Alandoorians
-- all of everybody -- know that a proper burial isn't just digging a hole and
hoping some passing necromancer doesn't notice.  That's what the crypts are for:
mighty fortresses of stone and life and sacred power.  Stone -- in arches and
vaults and beds -- to shelter the dead so burrowers and earthquakes do not
disturb their rest.  Sacred power -- enchantments of form and word -- to
blind, baffle, and bend away those who would abuse the sleepers.  Life --
gardens under the ground, of moss and mushroom and other things whose names
you do not yet know -- to transform the honored dead into stronger life.

No, the class where you learn those name will not be your favorite; stop
wheedling.  It's unbecoming of a knight.

At the bottom of each ramp, where it turns into a tunnel, you can see
three gates: cold iron, hard wood, and obdurate stone, each cunningly
crafted to permit inspection of the one beyond.  Further down the
tunnel, you know, there will be three more gates, in the opposite order,
marking the boundary between here-and-now and the there-and-when, past
and future together.  Each of the gates you can see stands open.

Instructor Badsmith exclaims, "What crimes are these?  The gates open
and unguarded, the fail-safes unstaffed?"  He marches briskly to the
closer winch and orders your class into defensive positions.  You end up
standing close enough to hear Evaroom report: "The problem isn't the
necromancy, although that's bad enough.  It's that the sacred power is
weakening even as we stand here.  We _must_ halt the decay as soon as
possible."

Instructor Badsmith grudgingly assigns Walv Anderson to lead the
vanguard.  As the strongest knight present, the instructor should be the
first into danger, but as the *only* knight present, he's also the only
and commanding officer.. and the commander shall not be hazarded
lightly. Walv is a fine squire, with good eyes and better ears; a choice
for point that you understand.  Or will understand, young Gwis; quit
interrupting.  What you're doing bringing up the rear, I don't know;
it's normally a position of great responsibility, which you will have done
nothing to deserve.

You continue to walk backwards, nonetheless; that's the rule.  It's the
responsibility of your squadmates to make sure you don't back into
anything, and one they've already taken seriously, letting you know where
the ramp down started and ended.  The ramp and the walls are made of the
same stone, sintered in some places and sundered in others in a regular
pattern designed to combat the freeze-thaw cycle.  Once you're fully
underground, the pattern will change; something you've heard but I don't
understand, about monocrystal construction simply falling all to pieces in
certain kinds of earthquakes.

It gets darker and darker, under the arches, as you walk further away
from the sun.  Your squadmates don't seem to stumble as much as you'd
expect, and you realize that their eyes have already adjusted, having
been looking into the dim light from the tunnel's ceiling the whole
way.  It's supposed to be a pale white, like the larger of the moons,
but something's wrong.  After a moment you figure it out: the walls and
floors -- all the stone in the tunnel that isn't supposed to be shedding
light -- is flourescing a pale blue.  You don't know what, if anything,
that means, but it's probably not a good sign.  Yes, you can guess at
what it means; no, I won't tell you if you're right.

The sound of the footsteps behind you changes suddenly, and halt; an instant
later, the gauntleted hand of Alvis Starseeker makes a sign in your peripheral
vision: _bridge step_.  Ah, of course; everyone should have thought earlier
that marching in step might be far louder than necessary in a confined and
echoing space.  You resume backing up.  You pass the gate of power, hammered
into shape by sorcerors and moonlight.  It hangs loosely on its hinges,
varicolored sparks trying to span the gap.  You pass the gate of life,
whose living branches wave slightly in spring breeze that isn't blowing,
trying to seal the breach.  You pass the gate of stone; the gates are
undamaged, but they swing freely over post-holes and the scattered debris
of the posts which once restrained them.

You examine the scene as you are able, between periods of looking and periods
of listening for trouble behind the column, but come to no conclusions.  You
hear a rustle in the ranks behind you, and the instructor and the healer
step out to either side of you.  "Nothing to report, sir," you report.

The instructor grunts, you think approvingly.  "The reverend" -- you file
the combat honorofic away for later -- "repaired the gates ahead, and we
sealed them.  When she's done here, lead the column up the ramp, to the
right of the winch, past the second winch, and down the other ramp.  Stop
at the first gate."

That puts you in the vanguard when the column actually enters the temple!
Startled, you salute -- the ramp, not the instructor, who has not relieved
you.  "When the reverend has repaired the gates, lead the column up the
ramp, to the right of the winch, past the second wench, and down the other
ramp, stopping at the first gate."  Reverend Evaroom giggles at something.

Instructor Badsmith frowns at you.  "Don't distract the spellcaster," he
hissed.  It was possible, you knew, to lose a spell if you were hit
while you were casting it; that was one of the reasons why squires in
your order didn't learn to cast spells until they were seniors, by which
time they'd either developed defensive skills or gone home in disgrace.
No way to protect others if you could not protect yourself, afer all.
But you'd never heard of giggling causing problems.

After a few generally nonsensical minutes, the repairs are complete -- you
and the instructor moved away from the column to stand close guard on the
reverend as she moved from gate to gate.  "The vanguard and I will stay
behind to seal the gates," the instructor says, "and the reverend will
wait at the top of the next ramp."  You nod.  Instructor Badsmith turns
to face the backs of the column and clears his throat.  Your squad, you assume,
looks over their shoulders, because he commands them with a revolving
finger, rather than speaking.  You hear the shuffling of feet move down the
tunnel away from you.  You wait an uncomfortably long time for the signal to
make its way back from the vanguard -- who, you assume, would not be turning
around, even with the gates newly sealed -- and for the instructor to tap you
on the shoulder.  You start marching up the ramp and immediately correct
yourself -- all the reasons for the bridge step still apply, all
training-ground reflexes aside.

Your squad joins you at the vanguard on your way up the ramp, but you can't
remember the hand-signal to ask about proper marching intervals before you
arrive at the other gate.  The blue-white glow and the tunnel the you can't
see the end of is only the second scariest thing you've ever seen -- no, you
haven't seen the scariest thing you've ever seen yet -- but you shake off
the fear and take a look around.  Reverend Evaroom raises an eyebrow --
does she know what you were feeling?  does she suspect you didn't actually
hear her or the instructor coming? -- and you just barely manage to avoid a
serious-looking but totally unjustified nod at the instructor as they work
their way through the column and down the ramp.  You check twice, and you're
quite sure that Walv and the real vanguard aren't with them.  You turn back
around, watching the tunnel and pondering purchasing a helm whose cheek guards
totally conceal your face.

After she's repaired the stone gate, Evaroom looks so worn that you offer her
a hand up without thinking about it.  She rises confusingly easily.  "It's not
that kind of tired, but I appreciate the thought."  She doesn't smile as warmly
as you were hoping, which will be confusing at the time, and will probably be
much more important to you later in life, until you manage to get over how
important you are to yourself.

No, of course I'm not going to explain.

Instructor Badsmith signals the advance and you -- and the reverend, at which
you two share a grin -- hasten to obey.  When you arrive at the next gate of
stone, the instructor whispers to no one in particular, "It's important to
rotate the troops, you understand.  Keeping the same soldier on point all the
time wears that point to a nub.  And we can't afford to lose our only cleric."

You shrug without moving your shoulders, which is a trick you will find to be
very useful in a great many situations in your career.  You were the vanguard
for quite some time, at least.  And if you consider it carefully, isn't
Badsmith saying that you -- or your squad -- is the second-best in the class?
That's a fair honor.  You give your squad a quick look-over.  They quite
properly ignore you in a way that suggests you have better things to be doing
with your eyes, and you return to watching the unceasingly ominuous tunnel.

The instructor remains far more stoic than you as the reverend proceeds to
do ... whatever it's she's doing, nearly to her own death, to judge by
appearances.  She swoons in fact repairing the last gate; it's clear, from
having seen her repair nine gates, that the gates of power are the hardest
for her and the gates of stone the easiest; you would have expected the gates
of life to bethe easiest, for a healer, but perhaps that's what she does than
who she is, really.  You almost form an uncomfortable question about your
parents, but decided better of it.

You glance -- again -- at Badsmith, and this time he relents.  You pick up
the fallen spellcaster -- feel the heat of her through your chainmail like
you might the sun -- and marvel as it fades, then worry as it fades, till
she's as chill as the packed ice you've certainly never thrown at another
squire.  "Sir?  I don't think she's well."

At your words, the cleric wakes up and shifts in your arms, laying her
head your surcoat's ying-yang symbol.  "Oh, that's very nice," she
murmurs, then abruptly stands up and coughs.  "Yes, I'd better go up and
make a tea for this cough."  She coughs again, twice, perhaps for emphasis,
and strides off.

The instructor finds this amusing for some reason.  You guess you're glad
*his* morale is high.  "Sir?"  You and the instructor had again stood close
guard on the cleric, with the rest of your squad between you and the crypt.
This time, though, with no one else in that interval, your squad was paying
much closer attention.  You gesture to indicate that they should open ranks
to let the rest of the column through before you and they and the instructor
start sealing the gates.

He mistakes your intention and signals a general advance.  "Anderson and
company will seal the gates behind us and hold there" -- in the tunnel
between the two sets of gates -- "until relieved."  An order oft given to
sentries, and of no particular import when so, but grim when given to a
garrison and desperate when given to a squad of novices under any
circumstance.  Badsmith reads these thoughts in your face.  "The principal
*is* on his way, and there are not enough bodies in this crypt to stop
the Order in its full array, should it come to that.  But if we don't have
to collapse both ramps..."

He trails off, but you've heard the stories, retold from class to class in
the barracks, and seen the shovels in the armory, terrible misshappen things,
razor sharp on one side and coming to a maul on the other.  Even if no squire
survived their relief... you shuddered.  There were deadlier fights, you've
been told -- imagine fighting corpses ignited in a crematorium but animated
before they burned, the flames themselves the curse of undeath but spreading
like any other fire -- but none more horrible.

"Yes, sir," you say quietly.  There were scarier things than rock and stone
that glowed and tunnels that did not end.


## Chapter 03

The tunnel did, actually -- and of course -- end.  It opened into a bluish,
or at least blue-lit, room with space for a dozen families to each cluster
around a plinth.  It's a like the base of a column, except you use it hold
up vases, usually; in Alandoor, of course, it's a place you can put the
down and distribute the burden of the good earth.  It's traditional for the
whole family to help carry it up the ramp, even if only one or two of the
adult descendants actually go all the way into the catacombs to collect it.

You were trying to remember the architecture word for the marble pieces on
the stone floor because you didn't want to think too closely or look too
hard at what was on one of them, desecrating it.  The perimeter, at first
glance, is clear: an open arch to the left, that you know goes into a room
for storing extra containers, just in case; a hallway, wide enough for a
whole family abreast, which you think goes staight back to the sifting
hall; and to the right, a pair of giant (five foot diameter at top,
three feet above the floor) planting pots, equally space against the wall.
The nearer pot's forget-me-nots, are, unsuprisingly, withered and
likely to crumble at another touch; you would have otherwise heard them
screaming from outside.  The further pot's Khyber Swallower is full and
twitching occasionally.  You were told, when you arrived in Alandoor, that
if you ever saw such a thing you should run screaming; some members of your
squad learned the same growing up here, and have found it easier to look at
the corpse than the plant.

You're not sure if the Swallower needs any help.  You catch the instructor's
eye and point at it; he looks over, considers it briefly, and shakes his
head.  You nod and point left.  He makes it an order, pointing at this
eyes with two fingers and then the arch with one.  You pass him on your way
over, and he whispers, "Somebody has to look at everything, but it doesn't
always have to be you."  He indicates the corpse with his head, and you realize
he isn't warning you about checking a side room on your own.  He's doing his
job, even now, teaching the next generation of officers.  You hope it's just
habit, and not prudence.  You shove the thought away.  Now you hope it's just
habit, and not that he thinks you're going to be an officer.

You search the closet with perhaps more vigor than is warranted, and manage
to avoid hearing anything unnecessarily disgusting as the more devout in
your squad get the joy of de-de-desecrating the plinth.  It might seem like
a waste of time, but every corpse the crypt's sacred power forces back into
slumber is another one you and yours don't have to fight.  Speaking of --
you cross the room, keeping a resolute eye down the hallway -- and see a
little water, fed in to the pot right at the rim to avoid touching the
leaves, will perk the alarm plant up any.  You'd rather not hear the alarm,
but surely strengthening a life here can only help.

One of your squad gave up their blanket to spare the remainder of the column.
Against the blue luminescence of the gray-white floor, the blood trickling
into the dust gutter looks black, like and totally unlike good earth.  The
dust gutter, too, would have to be resanctified; it was intended to hold
what good earth didn't make it into a container to be carried into the light,
swept and collected and used to help plant the gardens down here.  You look
away, and then down the hallway.  There was plenty of work for squires to do
today, work that the townsfolk could not do.

The instructor orders your squad forward, but does not join you; the burden
of leadership.  You ask Shabby to take point.  Shabby, surprised, looks at
you, looks at the instructor, and nods a few times, as if just learning
something important and silently repeating it until it becomes memory.  You
don't know if that's actually a thing for dwarves, or if Shabby was just making
ready to live up to the legends and not get lost.  The moment passes, and he
and your squad and you press on.

Shabby is a nickname.  Nobody in your class can pronounce Shabby's real
name, and you're pretty sure you can't even write it correctly; you never
had reason to learn the runic alphabet.

The hallway is a long barrel vault, of course; Shabby glances up once during
the long creep forward and grunts in disgust.  You're pretty sure that's just
Shabby getting into the role; you don't recall any prior opinions about
architecture, anyway.  Was the school built by dwarves?  You don't know,
and you shake the question away, causing the mail protecting your neck to
rasp.  Literally every body in the hallway turns around to stare at you
and you gesture dangerously in the direction of anger.  Quietly.  You gesture
quietly in the direction of danger.  Away from you, down the hallway, yes,
quit looking.  Good.  Breathe.

Since nothing attacks you, or anyone else, on the way, you're unsurprised to
find another empty room at the end of the hallway.  Rather, one devoid of any
undead.  And, pleasantly, nary a corpse.  The sifting hall -- the hallway
opens into a two-story room, onto the landing (you think that's the word
but hardly have time to check) at the top of staircase that goes down to both
left and right.  A balustrade (or maybe just a banister?) provides cover so
convenient that your entire squad crouches behind it without orders.  You
shrug -- without moving your shoulders -- and join them.  The sifting hall
is two stories tall along its entire length; you have no idea why, but it
does make it easy to see all the way over to the balcony on the far side,
probably a hundred feet away.
