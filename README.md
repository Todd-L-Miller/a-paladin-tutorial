# A paladin tutorial
_introducing a six-year-old to D&amp;D 5e_

The player character is **Gwis**, a (male) [human](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/lineage:human) with brown skin and shoulder-length curly gray hair.

Mechnically, Gwis is a second-level [paladin](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/paladin) who took the _Blessed Warrior_ fighting style, which gives him two cleric cantrips.  We did this for simplicity: the player doesn't have to learn about all of the first-level cleric spells and Gwis can cast the two spells Gwis knows as often desired; we'll teach the player about _Divine Smite_ and just say that it can only be used twice (a day) without explaining why.

The conceit for this tutorial is that Gwis hasn't finished paladin training yet, and isn't allowed to use certain abilities until given explicit permission by one of the school's instructors.  This allows us to introduce skills and/or abilities slowly and with some control over where they'd first be used (immediately after meeting the relevant instructor.
