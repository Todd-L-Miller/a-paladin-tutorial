## Section 1

_It's a rainy day in_ -- ask the player what the name of the small town in which the school is located, but we'll assume Alandoor -- _Alandoor, and although that does make it smell better, you've learned not to like the sound rains makes on your chain mail, because that means you're going to have dry, polish, and oil it again tonight.  You're wearing your armor and carrying your long sword in a sheath at your hip and your shield on your back because that's what squires at your school wear, that and brown boots -- your instructors like you too much to make you wear white boots -- and light gray pants and a light gray surcoat, on which you carefully stitched a yin-yang symbol, your_ [holy symbol](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/holy-symbol).  Ask the player about that.

_You and the rest of the class are standing out in the rain because the healer, Evaroom, finally made it all the way back around the county and back to Alandoor for the day, and the instructors hate it when you sword fight inside, even just for practice.  You'll have to learn how some day, but not any day soon, apparently.  Anyway, because Evaroom is here, it's safe -- safer, the instructors would say -- to practice using real weapons, and they've given their permission.  You get in a lot of trouble for doing anything fun without permission.  **Garth** and **Ennish** are fighting right now, in the middle of a ring of everybody.  As usual, Garth (a minotaur) has better foot-work, but Ennish (who says he's Cornish but looks more human than avian to you) moves his sword very quickly and sometimes wins because of that.  The practice field is all mud after just a few bouts, and after a few ringing attacks, parries, counter-attacks, and counter-parries, Ennish gets his blade past Garth's and forces him to jump out of the way.  He lands badly, slips in the mud, falls, and suddenly it's your turn to practice!_  Ask the player about their strengths and weaknesses in combat.  If they can't come up with anything, that's fine; they can just be one of those students who just slowly gets better at everything.

Introduce the core combat mechanics here.  You'll probably need to emphasize that the attack action is usually several seconds of fighting used to generate a chance at striking a damaging blow.  If your opponent gives you an opportunity -- by trying to run away without defending themselves, for instance -- you can try to hit them really good almost for free.  If you've fallen down, it becomes much harder for you to defend yourself effectively (if you want to get into advantage and disadvantage).

The instructor will pause the combat at some point, probably at the top of the round after the first damage is dealt, to give each combatant a chance to use _Lay on Hands_ to heal the other student.  That is, to give each student a chance to prove they can heal someone while they themselves are hurting -- make it explicit, then explain the rules.  (Ideally, the instructor will ask Ennish, so that the player has all of Gwis's resources to start off with.)

A second-level paladin has a pool of 10 HP for _Lay on Hands_, so it's not likely that the healer will be necessary, but if she is, have the instructor stop the fight there.

Once the healing is done, the action begins!  Proceed to [Section 2](https://github.com/Todd-L-Miller/a-paladin-tutorial/blob/main/section-02.md).
